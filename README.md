# OG UI Kit Buttons
This is coded version of the OG UI Kit Buttons, originally designed by [Oguz Yagiz Kara](https://twitter.com/oguzyagizkara) and coded by [Nusret Abuga](https://twitter.com/nusualabuga).

## Demo

You can see the demo of the project at [og-buttons.vercel.app](https://og-buttons.vercel.app).

## Project Structure

The project consists of a single `index.html` file that includes the styles and HTML structure for the buttons. The buttons are styled using CSS and the styles are included in the `<style>` tag within the `index.html` file.

## Usage

To use the buttons in your project, you can copy the HTML structure for the button you want to use from the `index.html` file and include the corresponding CSS in your project's stylesheet.
